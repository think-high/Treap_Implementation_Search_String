			///**\\\ Treaps implementaion to search a word from a big list effectively///**\\\

This is an implementation using treaps.Initially it loads the words from file to treap.
But after that it takes only O(L) time to search a word in the treap 

*** Time Complexity : O(L)
; where L is the no. of characters in the word.

*** NOTE:: Place all the words in words.txt file and store that file in the location where the main code is stored.

*** USES: For frequent queries at a search engine or other such stuff where string is to be matched frequently, hence fast.


*** Implementation:
All the words will be loaded in the treap when program is executed.

You can search the word you want,if it matches then "matched" will be displayed.
